“Cogito ergo sum” by René Descartes
<br />
<br />
<p></p>
Famous quote by philosopher René Descartes describes our philosophy. It translates in English as “I think therefore I am”. We commit ourselves to help students who want to learn. We will be providing effective tools in the hands of students. 
Currently, we are offering two ways for students to clear their doubts. One is by exclusively selected internet knowledge that found useful by teachers and fellow students. We would like to know your feedback, your contribution to make it better. Remember, smartest student is not the one who knows everything but who shares knowledge with others. We invite you to contribute and share what you found useful. 
Second way is to learn from each other. You can ask query and get answer from community. You can solve query of others and get self-satisfaction ;) 
Remember, this is a platform for you and more you participate more you will get out from this. It is infinite…

Bunch of parents want to change the education system from teaching to learning, from spoon feeding to self-motivation, to help Facebook generation in a unique way. We have experienced pain and tribulation of our kids. We worked more than two decades as global technology managers and decided to use technology as tool to change the system. We are open to listening to you. We believe current generation is smarter. We are just enablers to secure future of our youth.
